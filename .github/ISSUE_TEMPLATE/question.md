Please do NOT use the issue tracker to ask questions. The issue tracker is strictly for bug reports and feature requests, which are more than welcomed.

If you need help, the documentation on [Gatling](https://gatling.io/docs/current) and [gRPC Java](https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/java/) are both very helpful. This is a very small library, the problems you encounter are likely not Gatling-gRPC specific and can be solved by better understanding Gatling, gRPC, or general tooling.

If you get stuck, you can ask your question in Stack Overflow with the tag ["gatling"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gatling).
